"""Internal OAuth-client scope grants — grant / revoke / list.

For a SERVICE client, ``OAuthClient.allowed_scopes`` IS the grant record. A
person's application roles (``hcm:hr`` and friends) hang off a membership row
and are administered through ``internal_app_roles.py``; a machine principal has
no membership, so the operator-controlled column that already decides what the
client may ask for is where its authority lives. Since the token path emits an
org-bound client's namespaced scopes verbatim into the ``roles`` claim
(``routers/v1/oauth_provider._service_client_app_roles``), editing that column
is now an AUTHORIZATION change — and an authorization change should not require
`psql` against production.

Why not the existing surfaces
-----------------------------
``POST /oauth/clients/register`` REPLACES ``allowed_scopes`` wholesale on the
converge path. A consumer's checked-in bootstrap manifest re-running would
therefore silently WIPE a scope an operator granted by hand — the grant would
work until the next deploy of an unrelated service. ``PATCH /oauth/clients/{id}``
requires a human session (``get_current_user``) and also takes a whole list.
This surface is additive, single-scope, and idempotent, so a grant survives
every convergent re-registration and a retry is never destructive.

Auth
----
``verify_internal_api_key`` — the same ``X-Internal-API-Key`` dependency as
``internal_users.py``, ``internal_capability_links.py`` and
``internal_app_roles.py``, and the same swappable seam: declared once per route,
with no handler body depending on the shared key, so the ratified move to
janua-issued service tokens is a dependency swap rather than a rewrite.

What janua deliberately does NOT know
-------------------------------------
The scope string is OPAQUE. Janua stores it, matches it against the request, and
emits it verbatim when it has the namespaced shape. It holds no table of valid
apps and no vocabulary of role names — a new HCM role must not require a janua
deploy. What janua validates is SHAPE (``schemas/oauth_client_scope.py``).

Scope guarantee
---------------
There is no endpoint here that touches, reads, or returns a client SECRET, and
none that deletes a client. Revoking a scope removes one string from the list;
the client, its credential, and its audit history are untouched.
