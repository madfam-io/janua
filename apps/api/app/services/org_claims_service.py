"""Organization claims service — the SSOT for org/tenant/role token claims.

Computes the organization-membership claims that org-scoped resource servers
(symbiosis-hcm, and any future tenant-partitioned API) need in order to
authorize a caller at all. Every token-minting seam in janua — the OIDC
authorization-code grant, the OIDC refresh grant, `AuthService.create_session`
(magic link, password login, MFA completion, passkey) and
`AuthService.refresh_tokens` — resolves these claims *here*, not locally.

This module exists because the resolver used to live inline in
``routers/v1/oauth_provider.py``, which made it structurally unreachable from
the session path: a magic-link token carried no ``org_id`` at all, so
symbiosis-hcm answered 403 to every CTM team member who arrived through the
MAP's «Mi espacio (RH)» link. Two hand-maintained copies of a claim resolver
drift, and a drifted authorization claim fails either closed (someone stops
working) or open (someone gains a tenant) — so there is exactly one copy, and
the OIDC router imports it.

Claim contract
--------------

``orgs``
    Every ACTIVE membership as ``{id, slug, role}``. Omitted entirely when the
    user has none.

``org_id`` / ``tenant_id`` / ``org_slug``
    Emitted ONLY when unambiguous — exactly one active membership, or
    ``user.tenant_id`` names one of them. Ambiguity emits ``orgs`` alone;
    consumers must not guess a tenant. This is deliberate: guessing a primary
    org for a multi-org user is how one tenant's operator reads another
    tenant's payroll.

``madfam_org_roles``
    The user's organization roles (``owner`` / ``admin`` / ``member``) for the
    resolved primary org, under a namespace that says *which* authority issued
    them. **This is not, and must never be read as, an application role.**

``roles`` (application roles)
    ``"<app>:<role>"`` strings such as ``hcm:hr``, granted explicitly per
    organization member (``organization_member_app_roles``, migration 016).
    Emitted ONLY for the resolved primary org's own membership, and omitted
    entirely when there are no live grants. See the next section.

Application roles, and why they are the other half of the namespacing fix
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Namespacing ``madfam_org_roles`` was right and it left a hole. symbiosis-hcm
authorizes on application roles read from ``roles`` — ``hcm:hr``, ``hcm:admin``,
``employee`` (``symbiosis-hcm/apps/api/core/permissions.py``) — and nothing in
janua emitted a single ``hcm:*`` string. So CTM's Dirección could hold a valid
membership, receive a token with a correct ``org_id``, and still be refused
every HR feature: membership answered *which tenant*, and nothing answered
*which product authority*.

The claim is populated from EXPLICIT GRANTS ONLY. There is no derivation from
``member.role``, no default set, and no mapping table that turns an org
``admin`` into an ``hcm:admin``. Any such rule would rebuild, by the back door,
precisely the org-role-to-payroll bridge the namespacing exists to prevent — an
account admin would gain HR authority as a side effect of being an account
admin. If someone is to read payroll, an operator granted it, and there is a row
saying who and when.

Three scoping rules the resolver holds:

* **Only the resolved primary org's membership contributes.** Grants are keyed
  by ``organization_member_id``, so the query starts from ONE membership row and
  structurally cannot reach another org's grants. A multi-org user with no
  unambiguous primary org gets ``orgs`` and no ``roles``, for the same reason
  they get no ``org_id``.
* **Nothing is implicit for service accounts.** A service principal receives
  application roles on exactly the same terms as a person: those explicitly
  granted to its membership, and no others.
* **Revocation reaches a live session at refresh.** The query filters
  ``revoked_at IS NULL`` and every mint path re-resolves, so a revoked grant
  stops feeding the claim on the next rotation — the same property the
  ``status == "active"`` membership filter gives.

HOW THE CLAIM IS MERGED, and why the resolver does not return a ``roles`` key
itself. The OIDC path ALREADY emits a ``roles`` claim of its own — organization
roles, for clients that have read it for years, and it contains the bare string
``"admin"`` (``oauth_provider._get_user_entitlements``). In that handler
``**org_claims`` is spread AFTER ``"roles": entitlements["roles"]``, so a
``roles`` key coming out of this resolver would silently CLOBBER the legacy
claim — breaking existing consumers through nothing but dict ordering.

So the resolver returns application roles under the private key
``APP_ROLES_KEY``, and each minting seam merges them into ``roles`` explicitly:

* Session tokens (magic link, password, MFA, passkey) stamp application roles
  as ``roles`` and nothing else. A session token still carries NO organization
  role under that key — the invariant test in
  ``tests/unit/services/test_org_claims_service.py`` is unchanged and still
  passes, because what lands there is ``hcm:hr``, never ``admin``.
* The OIDC path UNIONS them onto the legacy list, so existing clients keep
  every string they read today and gain the namespaced application roles.

``merge_app_roles_into_claims`` below is that merge, written once so the two
seams cannot drift. Callers never see ``APP_ROLES_KEY`` in a token: the merge
pops it.

Why ``madfam_org_roles`` and not ``roles``
-----------------------------------------

The legacy ``roles`` claim (OIDC only) carries organization-membership roles —
``owner``/``admin``/``member`` — but its name promises nothing about the
namespace those strings live in. symbiosis-hcm read it as its HR role list, and
its ``HR_ROLES`` set contains the literal string ``"admin"``. So the moment
``org_id`` reached an HCM-bound token, every janua org *account* admin would
have become an HR admin over payroll and labour files. Sealing the org claim
without namespacing the role claim converts today's honest 403 into a payroll
leak.

Session tokens therefore stamp the namespaced ``madfam_org_roles`` and
**deliberately do NOT stamp a bare ``roles``**. A resource server that wants
org roles asks for them by their real name; a resource server that wants
application roles must source them from its own authority (HCM does exactly
this — see ``symbiosis-hcm/apps/api/core/permissions.py``). The OIDC path keeps
emitting ``roles`` unchanged for existing clients — this module adds the
namespaced claim alongside it, it does not remove anything.

Resolution never raises: a failure emits no org claims at all (fail-closed —
downstream org-scoped services reject, and never mis-scope).
