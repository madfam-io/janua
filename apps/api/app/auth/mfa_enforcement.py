"""Shared MFA-enforcement gate for the login paths.

2026-08-23 security fix. The completeness audit found MFA was enforced on exactly
ONE path (the JSON `/signin` endpoint) while the OAuth browser login, the OAuth
`/authorize` flow, and magic-link login all issued full sessions WITHOUT checking
`mfa_enabled` — so a user who "enabled 2FA" was unprotected on every path a real
product uses through Janua. This module centralizes the decision so every login
path enforces MFA identically, and gates it behind a DEFAULT-OFF flag so shipping
the enforcement cannot lock anyone out before the MFA-challenge UI is live.

Usage in a login path, immediately before it would create a session:

    if mfa_required_for(user):
        return mfa_challenge_response(user)   # JSON callers
        # or: redirect back to the login UI with ?mfa_required=1 (browser flow)

The challenge token this mints is consumed by POST /api/v1/mfa/challenge/verify,
which already exists and issues the real session once the second factor checks.
