## 💡 Key Takeaways

### What Worked Well
1. **Structured Reporting**: Week-day format makes progress tracking clear
2. **Metrics Dashboard**: Centralized metrics provide quick status overview
3. **ASCII Diagrams**: Visual architecture aids understanding
4. **Status Indicators**: ✅/⏳ symbols improve scannability
5. **Next Steps**: Clear action items prevent "what's next?" confusion

### Lessons Learned
1. **Documentation Lag**: Should document during implementation, not after
2. **Index Value**: Documentation index tremendously improves discoverability
3. **Visual Aids**: ASCII diagrams worth the effort for clarity
4. **Command Ready**: Copy-paste commands increase adoption
5. **Progressive Updates**: Regular README updates better than big bang

### Recommendations
